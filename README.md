# text-writer1.1
## Changelog
Version 1.0:
This is the base version of text-writer.

Version 1.1:
Now added single phrase writing ability, and made it so that inputs at the start that aren't 0 or 1 end the program.
## Information
It writes text from a document. This could be used to
spam people if you really wanted to. It is written in 
Python, and probably isn't the most optimised script 
ever. Before running the script, make sure that you
have clicked on the textbox or document, otherwise
the script won't work.
(You can find the documentation for pyautogui here: https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
__WARNING: This
program takes control over your keyboard, and makes typing
near impossible in some cases unless you deactivate the program.__ Also,
you need to have pyautogui installed for this to work.
If you, for some reason, can not deactivate the program,
moving your cursor in any of the four corners of your primary monitor will automatically
terminate the program, since ```pyautogui.FAILSAFE``` is true. 

Have fun!
